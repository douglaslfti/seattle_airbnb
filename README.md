## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You need to import the matplotlib and pandas libraries. In addition, the code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb Seattle data to better understand:

1. The average price of the type of property rented.
2. Level of satisfaction regarding the number of bathrooms.
3. The average amount spent depends on the region of origin of the host.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

In this project, two files were used, one containing the data to be explored, named 'listings' in '.csv' format and the other containing the code, which was developed in Google Colab in '.ipynb'. 

The Airbnb file can be found at the following address: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@douglaslfti/how-to-extract-information-from-the-airbnb-seattle-database-58468d134743).
